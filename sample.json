  "description": "The application uses the Inference Engine included in Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit. A trained neural network detects people within a designated area. The application checks if each detected person is wearing a safety-jacket and hard-hat. If they are not, a red bounding box is drawn over the person in the video. If they are wearing their designated safety gear, a green bounding box is drawn over them in the video.\nAttention: This sample has additional setup requirements that must be followed prior to launch. Please follow the sample's readme!",
